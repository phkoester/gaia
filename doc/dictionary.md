# Dictionary

This dictionary shows some frequently used terms and how to spell them.

Since the language to write is U.S. English, [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com) is the
recommended reference.

In some cases, where technical terms tend to be used as closed compounds, e.g. *toolchain*, the closed form
is preferred even though Merriam-Webster does not list it.

On open, closed, and hyphenated compounds, see
["Should that word have a hyphen?"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/hyphen-rules-open-closed-compound-words).

Prefixes such as *anti*, *meta*, or *non* need not be followed by a hyphen: *antialiasing*, *metadata*,
*nonnegative*.
